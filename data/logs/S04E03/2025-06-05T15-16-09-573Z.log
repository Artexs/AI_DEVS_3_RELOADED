  "_thinking": "The user is asking for a web interface address for controlling robots made for a client named BanAN. While the provided content talks about SoftoAI's offerings like automation, virtual assistants, and data prediction, there is no specific mention of a client named BanAN or a web interface for controlling robots. However, the urls provided in the content are: /, /uslugi, /portfolio, /aktualnosci, /kontakt, /loop, /czescizamienne. The most relevant URL could be /loop as it mentions 'Nasze roboty moÅ¼na podÅ‚Ä…czyÄ‡ do kontaktu!' which might hint at robot-related services. Somewhat relevant could be /uslugi since it talks about services offered. Least relevant could be /czescizamienne as it talks about spare parts which doesn't directly relate to a web interface.",
