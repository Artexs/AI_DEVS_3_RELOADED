```
Some nights I stay up, cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
Oh, what do I stand for? What do I stand for most nights?
I don't know anymore
This is it boys, this is war
What are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
See that fool in black and white
Tried twice as hard and the map is like wood
Here they come again to jack my style
That's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight
Stops my bones from wondering
Just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm
Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
But some nights I always win
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
Oh, what do I stand for? What do I stand for most nights?
I don't know
So this is it I sold my soul for this
Washed my hands without for this
I miss my mom and dad for this
Now you know
When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars
That's all they are
When I hear songs
They sound like a swan song
Come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Well, that's it guys
That is all
Five minutes in and I'm born again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave but I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All fried up in the desert sun
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the comments she'd call off
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
They can come from
Some terrible nights
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
The other night you wouldn't believe a dream I just had about you and me
I called you up and we promised to breathe
It's for the best we didn't listen
It's for the best we gave our distance
Oh, oh, oh
For the best we didn't listen
It's for the best we gave our distance
Oh, oh, oh

Podsumowanie tematyki piosenki:

- **Konflikt emocjonalny:** Tekst często wspomina o "niektórych nocach", co wskazuje na wewnętrzną walkę emocji i niepewności narratora.
- **Tożsamość i cel:** Narrator wielokrotnie pyta "Co reprezentuję?", co podkreśla poszukiwanie sensu i zrozumienia życia.
- **Bunt i rezygnacja:** Istnieje równowaga między pragnieniem „złamać zasady” a rezygnacją z wcześniejszych decyzji.
- **Poświęcenia osobiste:** Narrator wspomina tęsknotę za rodziną i konieczność dokonywania poświęceń.
- **Nadzieja i odporność:** Pomimo wyzwań, narrator nadal się „budzi” i konfrontuje swoje wspomnienia.
- **Relacje i dystans:** Ostateczne linie dotyczą relacji osobistych i potrzeby dystansu dla osobistego dobrobytu.
