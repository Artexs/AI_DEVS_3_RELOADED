There is no explicit data indicating what or where 'klucz123' might be. We've already checked the .env file for possible key-value pairs and inspected the directory listing for the src directory. The next logical step is to search within the 'src' directory for 'klucz123' in case it is defined within any file code or script. This approach aims to find the assignment or definition of this variable.","tool":"file_operations","query":{"operation":"search","path":"src","pattern":"klucz123"}}
