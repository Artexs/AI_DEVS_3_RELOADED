```
Some nights I stay up, cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

This is it boys, this is war, what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype, save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, but here
