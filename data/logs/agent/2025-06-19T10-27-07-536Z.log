The most relevant tool to locate and retrieve the content of a file is 'file_operations', which will help in searching and accessing the specified file within the directory.","tool":"file_operations","query":"Search for a text file with a name similar to 'extracted_t3xt' within the 'agent' folder and return its contents."}

[2025-06-19T10:27:14.823Z] RUN_AGENT___PLAN ---- Thinking... {"_reasoning":"The previous attempt to access the 'agent' folder failed due to a non-existing path. We should confirm the correct path or existence of the directory before proceeding with further file search operations. This step is crucial to ensure operations are performed on the correct directory.","tool":"final_answer","query":"Confirm if the path '/home/artek/Desktop/AI_DEVS_3_RELOADED/AI_DEVS_3/agent' is correct or if there has been a mistake. Alternatively, provide the correct directory path to perform the search operation for the file 'extrcted_t3xt'."}
