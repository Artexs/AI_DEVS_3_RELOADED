"Some nights I stay up, cashing in my bad luck  
Some nights I call it a draw  
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle  
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off  
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost  
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for  
Oh, what do I stand for? What do I stand for most nights?  
I don't know anymore  

This is it boys, this is war  
What are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already?  
I was never one to believe the hype  
See that fool in black and white  
Tried twice as hard and the map is like wood  
Here they come again to jack my style  
That's alright  
I found a martyr in my bed tonight  
Stops my bones from wondering  
Just who I am, who I am, who I am  
Oh, who am I?  
Mmm, mmm  

Well, some nights I wish that this all would end  
Cause I could use some friends for a change  
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again  
But some nights I always win  
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost  
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for  
Oh, what do I stand for? What do I stand for most nights?  
I don't know  

So this is it  
I sold my soul for this  
Washed my hands without for this  
I miss my mom and dad for this  
Now you know  
When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars  
That's all they are  
When I hear songs  
They sound like a swan song  
Come on  

Oh, come on  
Oh, come on  
Oh, come on  

Well, that's it guys  
That is all  
Five minutes in and I'm born again  
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands  
This one is not for the folks at home  
Sorry to leave but I had to go  
Who the fuck wants to die alone  
All dried up in the desert sun  

My heart is breaking for my sister  
And the comments she'd call off  
And then I look into my nephew's eyes  
Man, you wouldn't believe  
The most amazing things  
They can come from  
Some terrible nights  
Oh, oh, oh  

Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  

The other night you wouldn't believe a dream  
I just had about you and me  
I called you up and we promised to breathe  
It's for the best we didn't listen  
It's for the best we gave our distance  
Oh, oh, oh  

For the best we didn't listen  
It's for the best we gave our distance  
Oh, oh, oh
