It's possible that there was an error in how the task was communicated or that 'getCoordinates' is not a valid task recognized by the system. Since the goal involves retrieving GPS coordinates using this system, and failure to find this task means we cannot proceed with the current approach, the most logical step is to ask the user for guidance or further instructions. The current context suggests halting further actions until a valid task is identified or a new approach is defined.","tool":"final_answer","query":"The task 'getCoordinates' was not found. Please verify the task name or provide further instructions on how to proceed."}
