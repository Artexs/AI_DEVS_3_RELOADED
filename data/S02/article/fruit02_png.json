  "description": "The image shows a close-up of a strawberry placed on a smooth, reflective surface. The photo is in black and white, highlighting the texture and details of the strawberry. The seeds, which are usually visible on the surface of a strawberry, appear absent or less prominent, possibly suggesting the context of being seedless after transport. In the background, there is a blurred plastic container, adding depth to the image. The focus is primarily on the strawberry, and its reflection can be seen on the surface below. The overall composition has a clean, minimalist aesthetic."
