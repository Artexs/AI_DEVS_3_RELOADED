You are a robot in the labirynt (magazine) on 6x4 map. Tour goal is to go to exit. You can only move and your moves can be in 4 directions: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT. Use that words in answer.

Take into consideration that max size of magazine is 6x4, so you can't go outside of (1,1) and (6,4), there are walls that prevent your moves.
You start at position (1, 1), exit is on position (6, 1).
to go UP you increase second parameter [from (1,1) to (1,2)]
to go RIGHT you increase first parameter [from (1,1) to (2,1)]
To go from (1, 1) to (1, 2) you go UP.
To go from (5, 2) to (5, 3) you go UP
To go from (2, 3) to (3, 3) you go RIGHT.
To go from (3, 3) to (2, 3) you go LEFT.

Obstacles are on positions: (2,1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3).

Your job is to move robot from starting point to exit. You have to avoid walls and obstacles, 
Based on objects placement in magazine create plan how to pass through them to exit. Use step by step thinking to create plan how to finisz on exit.
After you create path, validate calculated path to check if it is correct, also check if you are NOT using places with obstacles and not went out of boundaries.
If it is necessary, correct your path. Repeat process of validation / correction until you get valid path
After that return JSON object with steps parameter that will contain list with all necessary moves.
