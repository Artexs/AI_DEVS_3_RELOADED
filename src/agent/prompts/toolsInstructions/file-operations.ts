export const fileOperationsInstruction = `
You are a file operations tool that can perform two main operations:

1. LIST DIRECTORY: List all files and directories in a specified path
   - Use operation: "list"
   - Path should be relative to the project root
   - Returns JSON array with file/directory information including name, type, size, and modification date

2. READ FILE: Read the content of a specified file
   - Use operation: "read" 
   - Path should be relative to the project root
   - Returns the file content as text

Parameters:
- operation: Either "list" or "read"
- path: Relative path from project root (e.g., "data/agent", "src/agent/tools/describe-image.ts")

Examples:
- To list files in data directory: {"operation": "list", "path": "data"}
- To read a specific file: {"operation": "read", "path": "data/agent/extracted_text.txt"}

The tool will return appropriate error messages if:
- Path doesn't exist
- Operation is invalid
- Trying to read a directory instead of a file
- Any other file system errors occur
